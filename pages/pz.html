    <p>Make perfect pizza at home with this pizza recipe, including an easy pizza dough recipe.</p>
        <ul> Ingredients:
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Mozarella cheese</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>How to make the pizza dough step by step:
        <li>Combine all the ingredients and gently knead with fingertips until a slightly sticky dough forms. You don’t need to knead too much, just until the dough forms. In the Kitchenaid, it took me about 3 mins.</li>
        <li>Place in an oiled bowl and turn the dough so the oil coats it.</li>
        <li>Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let it rise for about 20-25 mins or until doubled in volume.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and knead lightly until it forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a floured surface.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into a circle or rectangle, flouring it as you go.</li>
        <li>You can also transfer straight to your baking tray and flatten with your fingertips until the pizza crust reaches your desired thickness. Use oiled fingertips to make this easier</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <ol>To make the topping and assemble:
        <li>Boil the tomato sauce with some water and basil and salt</li>
        <li>Let it cool and spread on the pizza dough</li>
        <li>Add grated cheese on top and follow it up with onions, broccoli, cherry tomatoes, onion, capsicum, etc</li>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 375F / 200 C and bake for about 15-20 minutes or the pizza base base turns a golden brown</li>
        <li>Slice and serve pizza hot with chilli flakes and ketchup</li>
    </ol>
